        Firstly,
        <p>
          thank you for not closing the page when you saw my face, you have
          passed the test. Now you will be lucky enough to read all about me,
          there will be no more pictures, I promise.
        </p>

        Who am I?,
        <p>
          Well this is a rather existential question, I'm not even sure myself at times, as we can all be many things at many times.  So I will just give you the basics.  I am . . . 
          <ul>
            <li>From Derry, Northern Ireland</li>
            <li>Currently living in Norwich</li>
            <li>6 foot 2 inches tall</li>
            <li>Balding, but not bald.....yet</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        Education
        <p>
          Someone once told me 'you learn something new everyday'.  I didnt know that.  So I certainly learned something that day.  However in general terms I'm guessing you want to know where and what I have studied, well I have studied in . . . 
          <ul>
            <li>Derry</li>
            <li>Norwich</li>
            <li>London </li>
          </ul>
        </p>

      <h3>
        Job Experience
        <p>
          Dolly Parton sings about working 9 till 5, which is a real shame as this is often the hours most people work, which means, most people will not be able to see Dolly.  I would suggest she works evenings and weekends then more people would be able to attend her shows.  Heres some jobs I have done in the past . . . 
          <ul>
            <li>Bookmaker at William Hill</li>
            <li>Recruitment Consultant</li>
            <li>Electrical Maintenance Coordinator </li>
          </ul>

        My Top 10 words
        <p>
          Samuel Johnson once wrote "If you are tired of London you are tired of Life".  In that case I'm bloody knackered.  However he also wrote the first ever dictionary, which must have been a right old pain.  So in Sam's honour here are some of my favourite words today . . . 
          <ol>
            <li>Crash</li>
            <li>Bang</li>
            <li>Bonce</li>
            <li>Midas</li>
            <li>Smelt</li>
            <li>Cracker</li>
            <li>Nuance</li>
            <li>Bosh</li>
            <li>Wallop</li>
            <li>Filth</li>
